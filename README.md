Scenario for Cross Browsing Testing using TestNG & Selenium
With cross-browser testing, we make sure that the site is rendered the same on every browser :
- Why cross browser testing ? 
  - Font size mismatch in different browsers
  - JavaScript implementation can be different
  - CSS,HTML validation difference can be there
  - Some browser still not supporting HTML5
  - Page alignment and div size, Image orientation
  - Browser incompatibility with OS, etc.
